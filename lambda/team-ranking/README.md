### Team Ranking Statistics

1. **Basic Metrics**:
    - The number of wins (`nwin`) and losses (`nloss`) for each team are computed.
    - A win-loss ratio (`win_loss_ratio`) is calculated for each team.
    - The total number of games played (`ntot`) is also computed.

2. **Reliability Metrics**:
    - A `reliability_factor` is computed for each team. This is the proportion of games played by the team to a set maximum (`max_games_played`), capped at 1. This ensures that teams with more games have their stats considered more reliable.

3. **Regional Strength Metrics**:
    - The code computes an average win-loss ratio for the top teams (`top_teams_threshold`) in each region, providing an idea of the strength of the top teams in each region.
    - The total number of games played by all teams in a region is also considered. Regions with more games played might be more competitive or active.
    - A `region_strength` score is computed using both the average win-loss ratio and the total number of games.

4. **International Performance Metrics**:
    - The code identifies teams that have played in international tournaments.
    - It then computes the average win-loss ratio for these teams grouped by their original region, giving an insight into how teams from a particular region perform internationally.

5. **Comparison of Local vs. International Performance**:
    - The difference between a team's local and international win-loss ratio is computed (`performance_difference`). This indicates whether a team performs better or worse internationally compared to its local performance.

6. **Final Score & Ranking**:
    - A `raw_score` is computed using a weighted combination of `weighted_win_loss_ratio` and `performance_difference`.
    - This raw score is adjusted based on the `reliability_factor` to get the `final_score`.
    - Teams are then ranked based on this `final_score`.

### API Response Construction

- A list of teams, along with their ranks, is constructed and sent as a JSON response.
- If certain teams are missing from the final ranking, placeholders are added for them to ensure all requested teams are present in the response.

### Important Considerations

1. **Reliability**: 
    - The code factors in the number of games played by a team when ranking them. Teams that have played more games have more reliable stats.

2. **Regional Strength**: 
    - Regions with stronger top teams (based on win-loss ratio) and more games played overall are deemed stronger.

3. **International Performance**: 
    - How a team performs internationally compared to its local performance can significantly impact its rank.

4. **Final Score**: 
    - The final score for ranking teams is a combination of various factors, including basic metrics, reliability, regional strength, and international performance.

In summary, the ranking logic is comprehensive, considering various factors that could influence a team's strength and performance. The use of factors like reliability and regional strength ensures that the ranking is more nuanced than a simple win-loss count.
