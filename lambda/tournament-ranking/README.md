# Explanation of Team Ranking Logic

## 1. Data Collection:
   - **`get_tournament(id)`**: Fetches details about a specific tournament, such as its start and end dates.
   - **`get_tournament_matches(id)`**: Retrieves details about the matches in the tournament, specifically focusing on each team's wins, losses, ties, and total game wins.
   - **`recent_game_stats(team_ids, start_date)`**: Gathers game statistics for specific teams from six months prior to a specified start date up to that start date. It aggregates wins and losses for each team during that period. The idea is to get a recent performance trend of the teams.
   - **`league_comparison(start_date)`**: Gets the count of games played in each league from six months prior to the start date.

## 2. Processing and Ranking Logic (`process_tourney(id)`):
   - The function starts by fetching tournament details and matches related to the tournament.
   - It then uses the `recent_game_stats` function to get the recent performance statistics of the teams participating in the tournament.
   - A new DataFrame `df` is created from this data, and the following derived statistics are computed for each team:
     - **`nwin`**: Total number of wins.
     - **`nloss`**: Total number of losses.
     - **`win_loss_ratio`**: This is the ratio of wins to the total number of games (wins + losses). If a team has no losses, this value is just the number of wins. This metric gives an idea of the team's performance â€“ a higher value indicates a better performance.
     - **`ntot`**: The total number of games played (wins + losses).
   - Teams with a total number of games (`ntot`) less than a threshold (set to 10) are filtered out, ensuring that only teams with a substantial number of games are considered.
   - The remaining teams are sorted based on their `win_loss_ratio` and then by their total number of wins (`nwin`), with teams having higher ratios and wins coming first. This sorting forms the basis of the ranking.

## 3. Lambda Handler:
   - The `lambda_handler` function is the entry point when the Lambda function is invoked. It expects a `tournament_id` in the query string parameters.
   - It then invokes the `process_tourney` function to rank the teams based on their recent performance statistics.
   - The ranked list of teams is returned as a response, including their `team_id`, `team_code` (acronym), `team_name`, and their respective rank.

## Summary:
The ranking of teams is primarily based on their performance in recent matches, specifically looking at the ratio of their wins to total games played, and then considering the total number of wins. This approach ensures that teams that have been consistently winning in recent matches are ranked higher, providing a dynamic ranking that responds to recent team form.
